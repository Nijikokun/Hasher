Hasher is a small but powerful URL Hash Routing script. It allows you to easily manage and create routes as well as apply object and functions to those routes.

Usage:

    // Setup the Hasher
    Hasher.setup();
    
    // Add a route
    Hasher.add("name/:name", function(name) {
        // Alert
        alert(name);
        
        // Console
        console.log(name);
    });
